# Advanced Features

## Migrations

EF Core migrations work with SqliteWasmBlazor, but require special configuration due to WebAssembly limitations.

### Project Structure Recommendation

Put your DbContext and models in a **separate project** (e.g., `YourApp.Models`):

- Reference this project from your Blazor WebAssembly project
- Configure `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` with minimal assets:

```xml
<!-- In YourApp.Models.csproj -->
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design" Version="10.0.0">
    <IncludeAssets>runtime; analyzers;</IncludeAssets>
    <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
</PackageReference>
```

This prevents design-time assets from being published with your WebAssembly app, which would cause errors.

### Generate and Apply Migrations

```bash
# Generate migration (run from models project directory)
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --context TodoDbContext

# Apply migrations at runtime (in your Blazor app)
await dbContext.Database.MigrateAsync();
```

The `InitializeSqliteWasmDatabaseAsync` extension method automatically applies pending migrations during app startup.

## Full-Text Search (FTS5)

SqliteWasmBlazor supports SQLite's FTS5 (Full-Text Search 5) virtual tables for powerful text search capabilities.

### Define FTS5 Entity

```csharp
public class FTSTodoItem
{
    public int RowId { get; set; }
    public string? Match { get; set; }
    public double Rank { get; set; }
    public TodoItem? TodoItem { get; set; }
}
```

### Configure in DbContext

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<FTSTodoItem>(entity =>
{
    entity.HasNoKey();
    entity.ToTable("FTSTodoItem");
    entity.Property(e => e.Match).HasColumnName("FTSTodoItem");
});
```

### Create FTS5 Table via Migration

Manually edit the migration file:

```csharp
migrationBuilder.Sql(@"
    CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE FTSTodoItem USING fts5(
        Title, Description,
        content='TodoItems',
        content_rowid='Id'
    );
");
```

### Search with Highlighting

```csharp
var results = dbContext.Database
    .SqlQuery<TodoItemSearchResult>($@"
        SELECT
            t.Id, t.Title, t.Description,
            highlight(FTSTodoItem, 0, '<mark>', '</mark>') AS HighlightedTitle,
            highlight(FTSTodoItem, 1, '<mark>', '</mark>') AS HighlightedDescription,
            rank AS Rank
        FROM FTSTodoItem
        INNER JOIN TodoItems t ON FTSTodoItem.rowid = t.Id
        WHERE FTSTodoItem MATCH {searchQuery}
        ORDER BY rank")
    .AsNoTracking();
```

### FTS5 Features

- Full-text search across multiple columns with relevance ranking
- `highlight()` function for marking search matches in full text
- `snippet()` function for contextual excerpts with configurable token limits
- Automatic query sanitization to handle special characters safely
- Support for phrase searches, prefix matching, and boolean operators

See the demo application for a complete FTS5 implementation example.

## JSON Collections

Store complex types as JSON in SQLite:

```csharp
public class MyEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public List<int> Numbers { get; set; }
}

// In OnModelCreating:
entity.Property(e => e.Numbers)
    .HasConversion(
        v => JsonSerializer.Serialize(v, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null),
        v => JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<int>>(v, (JsonSerializerOptions?)null) ?? new()
    )
    .Metadata.SetValueComparer(
        new ValueComparer<List<int>>(
            (c1, c2) => c1!.SequenceEqual(c2!),
            c => c.Aggregate(0, (a, v) => HashCode.Combine(a, v.GetHashCode())),
            c => c.ToList()
        )
    );
```

The `ValueComparer` is essential for EF Core to detect changes in collection properties.

## Logging Configuration

### Worker Log Level

```csharp
// Set worker log level (affects SQL logging in browser console)
SqliteWasmLogger.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.Warning);
```

### EF Core Logging

```csharp
// In Program.cs
builder.Logging.AddFilter("Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command", LogLevel.Warning);
builder.Logging.AddFilter("Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure", LogLevel.Error);
```

### Per-Connection Logging

```csharp
// Specify log level in connection constructor
var connection = new SqliteWasmConnection("Data Source=MyDb.db", LogLevel.Debug);
```

Available log levels: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning` (default), `Error`, `Critical`, `None`

## Custom EF Core Functions

All EF Core functions are implemented for full compatibility:

| Category | Functions |
|----------|-----------|
| **Arithmetic** | `ef_add`, `ef_divide`, `ef_multiply`, `ef_mod`, `ef_negate` |
| **Comparison** | `ef_compare` |
| **Aggregates** | `ef_sum`, `ef_avg`, `ef_min`, `ef_max` |
| **Pattern Matching** | `regexp` (for `Regex.IsMatch()`) |
| **Collation** | `EF_DECIMAL` (for proper decimal sorting) |

### Decimal Arithmetic Example

```csharp
// This LINQ query uses ef_multiply under the hood
var expensive = await dbContext.Products
    .Where(p => p.Price * 1.2m > 100m)
    .ToListAsync();
```

EF Core automatically translates decimal operations to the appropriate `ef_*` functions, ensuring correct arithmetic in SQLite (which doesn't have native decimal support).

## Moving Databases In and Out

`ISqliteWasmDatabaseService` carries the whole file surface — one database or
many, in or out, to a `Stream` or straight to a browser download. **No path
holds a database in managed memory.** That is not an optimisation: mobile
Safari kills the page when a multi-hundred-megabyte export lands in memory, and
a large import assembled on the main thread takes the pool's access handles
down with it.

```csharp
@inject ISqliteWasmDatabaseService DatabaseService

// Straight to a download. The worker copies the database into an OPFS staging
// file in slices and the browser saves from that disk-backed File.
await DatabaseService.ExportDatabaseToDownloadAsync("TodoDb.db", "todo-backup.db");

// Several databases as one .dbs envelope (MessagePack [name, bytes] tuples).
await DatabaseService.ExportDatabasesToDownloadAsync(names, "backup.dbs");

// Same bytes as the download, into a Stream you own.
await using var file = File.Create(path);
await DatabaseService.ExportDatabaseToStreamAsync("TodoDb.db", file);

// Import, one chunk at a time into the worker.
await using var stream = picked.OpenReadStream(maxAllowedSize: picked.Size);
await DatabaseService.ImportDatabaseFromStreamAsync(
    "TodoDb.db", stream, picked.Size);
```

Every one of these closes the database in the worker — exports for a consistent
snapshot, imports because the slot is being replaced under it. Connection-state
tracking re-opens it on the next EF Core query; there is no manual dance.

With `SqliteWasmBlazor.Crypto` loaded the worker is state-aware and the calls do
not change: a plain pool reads and writes plain pages, an unlocked encrypted
pool decrypts on the way out and rekeys on the way in. A locked pool refuses
with `PoolOperationRejectedException` — unlock first.

> **Exports are plaintext.** On an encrypted pool these emit a plain `.db` any
> SQLite tool can open, which is the point of an export but worth saying out
> loud in your UI before the user clicks. The `.eds` envelope on
> `IEncryptedSqliteWasmDatabaseService` is the encrypted-backup path.

### Validating What an Import Brought

Both import methods take an optional `validateImported` delegate. What the
import would replace is parked under a suffixed name, the incoming file is
written under the database's **real** name, and the delegate opens it and
decides:

```csharp
await DatabaseService.ImportDatabaseFromStreamAsync(
    "TodoDb.db", stream, size,
    async (imported, ct) =>
    {
        await using var ctx = await DbContextFactory.CreateDbContextAsync(ct);
        await ctx.ValidateImportedSchemaAsync(ct);   // throws SchemaMismatchException
    });
```

Throw and the pool goes back exactly as it was — the parks are renamed back,
metadata-only, so what returns is byte-identical. Return and the import counts:
the parks are dropped and the host's migrations re-run, so a file carrying an
older schema is brought up to date and an owned database the import omitted is
re-created before the next query hits it.

Writing under the real name is not a detail. On an encrypted pool, page AAD
binds ciphertext to the database path, so a file written under a staging name
would stop decrypting the moment it was moved.

### Telling the Library Which Databases You Own

`MigrateAsync` and the schema gate need something only the host knows — which
databases the app opens, and what their schema is supposed to be. Implement
`IHostDatabaseService` and register it once:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHostDatabaseService<MyHostDatabaseService>();
```

Apps using `SqliteWasmBlazor.Crypto.UI` implement `IHostRecoveryService`
instead — the same three members plus `IsAvailable` and `ResetAsync` for the
panels' recovery affordance — and register with `AddHostRecoveryService<THost>()`,
which binds one instance to both interfaces.

### Downloads Installed on a Home Screen

A web app installed on a Home Screen has no downloads folder, so WebKit drops the
`download` attribute and navigates to the file instead: a finished export arrives
on a full-screen OS intermediate screen — an icon, a size, and "Open in
&lt;app&gt;" — and the user saves it from that screen's share menu. The export
itself is unaffected, because WebKit streams the disk-backed staging file onto
that screen, so it holds at any size.

Worth a line of UI copy above your export controls: it is the one place where the
export looks like it failed while having entirely succeeded, and the OS screen
covers anything you could say afterwards. Handing the file to `navigator.share`
instead is a trap worth naming — the share sheet has to materialise the file to
pass it to another process, so it dies on a large database, while this path does
not.

### Schema Validation

Validate that an imported database matches the expected EF model schema:

```csharp
using SqliteWasmBlazor.Models.Extensions;

await using var ctx = await DbContextFactory.CreateDbContextAsync();
await ctx.ValidateSchemaAsync();
// Throws InvalidOperationException with missing table names if schema doesn't match
```

Table names are derived from EF model metadata — no hardcoded strings.

### Safe Import Pattern

There is no pattern to write: pass `validateImported` and the park-and-restore
above happens inside the import. Rolling it by hand with
`RenameDatabaseAsync` cannot match it — a rename onto an occupied name leaves
the occupant's slot claimed but unreachable, and splitting the job into
delete-then-rename leaves a window where the backup and the import that
displaced it both stand with nothing to say which one is the database.
