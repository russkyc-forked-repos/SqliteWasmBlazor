/// <summary>
/// Reactive model behind <see cref="AuthenticationPanel"/>: the
/// <c>NotAuthorized</c>-branch panel for sign-in / register with a passkey.
/// Sole writer to <see cref="PrfAuthenticationStateProvider"/> for the auth-
/// panel flow.
///
/// <para>The panel has exactly two shapes, and the disk picks which one:
/// an encrypted VFS is bound to the credential its manifest names, so it
/// offers <see cref="SignIn"/> alone (targeted at that credential); a plain
/// VFS offers <see cref="SignIn"/> (discoverable picker) and
/// <see cref="Register"/> together. One click runs one ceremony — an
/// abandoned prompt reports a warning and leaves the shape untouched, so
/// cancelling always lands back where it started.</para>
///
/// <para><see cref="RefreshDiskStateAsync"/> is the single manifest read
/// behind that: it runs on context-ready, on TTL expiry
/// (<see cref="IPrfService.KeyExpired"/> filtered on the seed key →
/// <see cref="OnSessionExpiredAsync"/>), and on
/// <see cref="ClearKeysAsync"/> / <see cref="SignOutAsync"/> — every route
/// by which the panel becomes visible again. Disk reset therefore drops
/// <see cref="CredentialId"/> and a mid-session
/// <c>EnterEncrypted</c>/<c>LeaveEncrypted</c> is picked up too, without
/// either needing a special case.</para>
///
/// <para><see cref="CredentialId"/> + <see cref="PublicKey"/> each fire
/// <see cref="PushAuthState"/>, which is the single point that updates
/// <see cref="PrfAuthenticationStateProvider"/>.</para>
